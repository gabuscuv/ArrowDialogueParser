# ArrowDialogueParser

- A quick and probably fast tool for Export [Arrow's](https://github.com/mhgolkar/Arrow) Dialogues to csv for easy and quick integration on Game Engines and Localization Staff. 
- Written in golang, based on an unreleased/incomplete tool mine. (An REST API Tracker whose data uses JSON) but It's only a main.go file, It's more a script than a program.
- It's done for myself, It's not very customizable, It doesn't have ensurement checks (but for I/O, Parsing Exceptions), and It's made in half-day.
- It's more like for refresh my knowledge about unstructured JSON Handling in golang than useful for everyone.
